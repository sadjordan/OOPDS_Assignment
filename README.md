Current features:
- Reads the text file
- Processes text file into two dynamic arrays, one for settings and the other for the map
- Randomly places the ships according to the settings onto the map

To be developed:
- A way to determine which ship is which (likely using a pair system similar to vector pair)
- Moving ships
    - Need an algorithm for this
- Ships looking around
- Ships shooting
- Ships destroying ships
- Respawn mechanism
- Simulation loop

Notes by me (Jordan):
- Basic stuff is out of the way now so it's just the logic for the ships we have to do now
